## General Background
Fabric builds on a few other major technologies, including merkle trees,
blockchains, and distributed hash tables.  Many of these ideas can be contained
in an acronym, but YMMV (your mileage may vary) with regards to keeping track of
them all.  Organized here are a few categories of links to read, at your
leisure.

### What are Blockchains?
Much like a hashtable, a blockchain is a specific form of data structure that
can be used to ensure synchronization across a distributed system.

The best place to start learning the deeper meanings of these ideas is [the
Nakamoto Institute's essays on the matter][institute].  Feel free to edit this
document with any improvements you are inspired to create whilst on your
journey!
