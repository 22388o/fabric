Fabric is an experimental approach to the secure establishment and execution of
peer-to -peer agreements, up to and including financial transactions.  With a
robust library of common components, `npm i @fabric/core` provides all the tools
one might `require` during the development of a well-researched application of
decentralization technology.

| ðŸš¨ Heads up! |
|--------------|
| Use of Fabric in production is **not recommended** in its current state.  Please wait for [an official release][releases] before deploying to production environments. |

## Getting Started
If you're already familiar with `node` and have a project already started, try
`npm install --save @fabric/core` to install [Fabric Core](https://fabric.pub),
the primary library used for most Fabric-based applications.

Fork and clone [the Fabric GitHub repository][fabric-github] and launch a local
web server with `npm run examples` to view the examples, or `npm run docs` once
you're ready to integrate Fabric into your application.

## Available Commands
- `npm run cli` provides a direct command-line interface to the Fabric network.
- `npm run docs` creates a local HTTP server for browsing documentation.
- `npm run examples` creates a local HTTP server for interacting with examples.
- `npm start` creates a local Fabric node.

## API
The Fabric reference implementation exposes a simple message-passing interface
using [the actor model][actor-model].

### Using as a Library
#### Simple Example
```js
const Fabric = require('fabric');
const service = new Fabric();
```

`service` now contains a full instance of Fabric, including `SET` and `GET`
methods for publishing and retrieving documents.  Use `npm run examples` to see
more.

## Other Fabrics
Several other projects have used the name Fabric, as it's a great way to
describe a network of things, conjuring feelings of _nets_ and _webs_.  Here are
some links to them, as they offer some interesting things completely unrelated
to our goals.

- Fabric python project (#fabric on Freenode)
- Fabric application framework by Twitter
