      <h1>Fabric</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">a data layer for the distributed web</p>

      <section>
       <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p>Building products that fully utilize the power of emerging technology is hard.  That's why we built <a href="">Fabric</a>, a standardized API for designing and deploying decentralized apps.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>Building Your First Decentralized Application</h3>
        <p>We'll be using <a href="">Maki</a>, a library of user interface elements which integrate directly with Fabric.  We'll provide definitions for how our application should behave, and the core Fabric library will handle the rest.</p>

        <p><small><strong>Heads up:</strong> from here on, we're going to assume you're familiar with console commands and the modern JavaScript ecosystem.  If you're just getting started, try <a href="https://maki.io/tutorials/initial-setup">Maki's Initial Setup</a> and share your progress in <a href="https://maki.io/topics/learning">#learning</a>.</small></p>

        <p>Start by creating the following <code>app.js</code> file.</p>

        <h4>app.js</h4>
        <pre class="code">
          var Fabric = require('fabric');
          var Maki = require('maki');
          
          var app = new Maki();
          
          app.start();
        </pre>
        
        <p>This defines and starts a simple HTTP <a href="oracle.html">Oracle</a>, and displays a link in your console.  You can browse this link now, or read on to add some functionality.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Adding a Data Layer</h4>
        <p>Fabric adds a simple synchronized datastore to your applications, allowing your users to keep a collection of the data they've consumed.</p>
        <p>This data can be used to run applications locally, without the need for a network connection.  Let's add one now.</p>
        <p>Place this code before <code>app.start();</code> to add a new <code>Post</code> resource:</p>
        <pre class="code">
          app.define('Post', {
            attributes: {
              content: { type: String }
            }
          });
        </pre>
